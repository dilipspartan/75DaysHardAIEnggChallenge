# 75DaysHardAIEnggChallenge
75 days of self-imposed, focused learning and building in AI Engineering. Tracking my progress, projects, and notes.

Master AI engineering stack and be on top of the list.

My focus areas include:

Developing robust machine learning pipelines.

Mastering cloud infrastructure for AI (e.g., AWS/GCP/Azure).

Deep dives into MLOps tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Weights & Biases).

Feel free to star ⭐️, fork 🍴, and follow along! Let's learn and grow together.
